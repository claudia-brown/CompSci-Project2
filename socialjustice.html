    <div class="box e">A large percentage of the homeless population in 
	Los Angeles suffer from severe mental illnesses or disabilities. These 
	disorders lead to behavioral problems that make it harder for people to 
	carry out daily activities and maintain a normal lifestyle. They push away 
	their family and friends who could offer a helping hand. As a result of these 
	factors and the stresses of living with a mental disorder, people with mental 
	illnesses are much more likely to become homeless than people without. People 
	are living on the street because of something they cannot control. (Source:
