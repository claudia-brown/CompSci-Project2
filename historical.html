    <div class="box e">Homelessness first emerged as a crisis in Los Angeles 
	in the 1980s, when encampments began to appear under downtown freeway 
	overpasses. Poor living conditions caused the camps to be shut down. 
	Over time people have tried to help, putting portable toilets for sanitation, 
	but the efforts were refuted by the government. Skid row has become a dumping 
	ground for hospitals, prisons and other cities to get rid of people with nowhere 
	else to go. Homeless people on skid row are expected to enter shelters, graduate 
	to transitional housing and finally earn permanent housing through good behavior, 
	including sobriety. But every situation is different, and many people fall off that 
	path and never return. (Source: Los Angeles Times)
