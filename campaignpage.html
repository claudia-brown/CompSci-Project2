    <div class="box e">Places like the Los Angeles Mission and Anne Douglas 
	Womens Shelter provide clothes, food, and shelter for people living on 
	Skid Row. They are even given the opportunity to enter a faith-based program 
	that helps them rejoin society. During the holidays, there is an increase in 
	support, but there are not enough volunteers year-round. You do not have to be 
	a rich, famous celebrity to donate and do your part. Donating old clothes or 
	volunteering your time has just as big of an impact.</div>
